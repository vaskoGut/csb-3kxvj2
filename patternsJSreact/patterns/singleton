Singleton - classes which can be instantiated
once and can be accessed globally.


// why it doesnt meet Singleton criteria
let counter = 0;

class Counter {
  getInstance() {
    return this;
  }

  getCount() {
    return counter;
  }

  increment() {
      return ++counter;
  }

  decrement() {
      return --counter;
  }
}

// cause singleton can be instantiated once, and
// this example can be instantiated more times

constructor() {
  if(instance) { // it prevents creating more than 1 instance
    throw new Error("You can only create one instance!");
  }
  instance = this;
}

const singletonCounter = Object.freeze(new Ccounter());
// Object.freez makes sure consuming code cannot modify SIngleton.

Singleton in react.
We rely on tools like Redux or React Context.
Their global state - isn't mutable in comparison to
Singleton. It's only readable.
In redux pure function updating state.
