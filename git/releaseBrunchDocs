1. Let's suggest we're merging our desired changes to Dev and know want to release it.
2. from dev we're creating a release brunch and a pull request to Master
3. dev brunch can be updated with new commits, it will not conflict with release now
4. release brunch can be connected to host for testing purposes.
5. If everything's good, we're merging release to master.
6. If it (commits) was smth new on release brunch added, it should be updated, merged also to dev, to avoid conflicts.
thats all :)
